## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
    id: 'schedule_[timestamp]_[random]',
    title: 'Event Title',
    description: 'Event description or details',
    date: '2024-02-28',
    time: '14:00',
    category: 'exam|lecture|assignment|event|meeting|other',
    location: 'Room 101, Building A',
    priority: 'low|medium|high|urgent',
    createdBy: 'staff1',
    createdAt: '2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z',
    updatedAt: '2024-01-20T15:30:00.000Z'
}
```

### localStorage Integration
